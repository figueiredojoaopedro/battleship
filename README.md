ðŸ“„ ADR 001 â€“ Use React and TypeScript for Frontend Development

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-05-13
Context:
We are developing a browser-based Batalha Naval (Battleship) game. The frontend must support a dynamic UI with interactive components, such as game boards, cells, and drag-and-drop ship placement. We also want strong typing and developer tooling to avoid runtime errors during gameplay.

Decision:
We chose to use React with TypeScript for the following reasons:
â€¢ React offers a component-based structure which fits well for building the board, cells, and controls as reusable units.
â€¢ TypeScript enhances code reliability with static typing, catching errors at compile-time.
â€¢ The React ecosystem (e.g., hooks, dev tools, libraries) will help with state management, interactivity, and future scalability.
â€¢ We will use create-react-app with the TypeScript template to scaffold the project quickly.

Consequences:
â€¢ Developers must have familiarity with both React and TypeScript.
â€¢ We need to define and maintain custom types for game-related entities (e.g., ships, cells).
â€¢ We will benefit from improved maintainability, type safety, and editor support (autocomplete, type checking).
â€¢ Future architecture decisions (e.g., multiplayer support, state management with Redux or Zustand) will need to align with this tech stack.

1. âœ… Design the board layout (10x10 grid using Tailwind and components)
2. âœ… Create reusable <Cell /> and <Board /> components
3. âœ… Add game logic (turns, ship placement, hits/misses)

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from "eslint-plugin-react-x";
import reactDom from "eslint-plugin-react-dom";

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    "react-x": reactX,
    "react-dom": reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs["recommended-typescript"].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
});
```
